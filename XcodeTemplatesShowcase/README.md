The repository contains examples of XcodeTemplates. It is a part of a presentation included in the project 

## Template installation

The project contains an example of MVVM template using SwiftUI.

To add MVP template to your Xcode run command:
```
./mvp_template_installer install
```

The command could also be added as a RunScript in Xcode's Build Phases so each team member would have the template installed automatically.
